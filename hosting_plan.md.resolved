# Website Hosting Plan (India)

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for hosting and maintaining a modern web application (like the Vetri DJ Booking System) in India.

## 1. Hosting Details

### Hosting Types
*   **Shared Hosting**: Multiple sites share one server. Cheapest but lowest performance. Best for small static sites.
*   **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: A dedicated portion of a server. Offers better control and performance. Good for growing apps.
*   **Dedicated Hosting**: Entire physical server for one client. Highest performance and security, but expensive.
*   **Cloud Hosting (PaaS/IaaS)**: Scale resources dynamically. Examples: **AWS**, **Vercel**, **DigitalOcean**. Preferred for Next.js apps.

### Top Providers in India

## 2. Steps for Hosting a Website

### Step 1: Domain Registration
1.  Search for availability on **BigRock.in** or **GoDaddy India**.
2.  Purchase a `.in` or `.com` domain.
3.  Set up Auto-renewal to prevent downtime.

### Step 2: Server Setup & Configuration
1.  **Select Region**: Choose **Mumbai** or **Hyderabad** data centers to minimize latency for Indian users.
2.  **SSL Certificate**: Install Let's Encrypt (usually free) for HTTPS.
3.  **DNS Management**: Point `A` or `CNAME` records to your server IP.

### Step 3: Performance Optimization
-   **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use **Cloudflare** with Indian edge nodes (Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi) for fast asset loading.
-   **Caching**: Implement Redis or server-side caching for database queries.

## 5. Full Project Process

### Timeline (8-12 Weeks)
1.  **Planning (Week 1-2)**: Requirement gathering, sitemaps, and database schema design.
2.  **Design (Week 3-4)**: High-fidelity UI/UX mockups and prototyping.
3.  **Development (Week 5-9)**:
    -   *Sprint 1*: Backend API & DB setup.
    -   *Sprint 2*: Frontend UI components.
    -   *Sprint 3*: Integration & Logic.
4.  **Testing (Week 10)**: Unit testing, UAT, and cross-browser compatibility.
5.  **Deployment (Week 11)**: Production build, DNS cutover, and monitoring setup.
6.  **Maintenance (Ongoing)**: Monthly backups, security patches, and performance tuning.

### Scalability Consideration
Use **Horizontal Scaling** (adding more server instances) and **Database Indexing** to handle high-traffic wedding seasons in India.
